    "CO$_2$ from an industrial site can be compressed and injected into a deep saline aquifer for storage. This technology is called __CO$_2$ capture and storage__ or __CCS__, proposed in (TODO) to combat global warming. As CO$_2$ is lighter than the saline water, it may leak through a natural fracture and contanimate the drinking water. Therefore, monitoring and predicting the long term fate of CO$_2$ at the deep aquifer level is crucial as it will provide an early warning for the CO$_2$ leakage. The goal is to __interprete the time-series data recorded in the seismic sensors into spatial maps of a moving CO$_2$ plume.__ A problem very similar to CT scanning widely used in medical imaging.\n"

The advantage of using a random walk forecast model is that now we are dealing with a linear instead of nonlinear filtering problem, and the computational cost is much lower as we don't need to evaluate $f(x)$. However, when $dt$ is very large, this random walk forecast model will give poor predictions, and the prediction error, i.e., $w_k$ cannot be well approximated as a zero mean Gaussian noise $\\approx N(0,Q)$. Therefore, the random walk forecast model is only useful when the measuremetns are sampled at a high frequency, and $Q$ has to be seclected to reflect the true model error. "
